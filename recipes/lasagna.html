        <h3>Ingredients Required</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
                <li>Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
                <li>Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
                <li>Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
                <li>Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
            </ul>
